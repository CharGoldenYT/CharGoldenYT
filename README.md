# Hey buddy, name's Char!
[I have a few discord servers](https://discord.vschar-official.com) and Mainly program in Haxe/HaxeFlixel, but occasionally use Python.

Currently working on 2 projects, that being the [VS Char FNF mod](https://github.com/CharGolden-Games/VSChar-Universe-Engine), and a standalone game named [Char's Adventure](https://github.com/CharGolden-Games/Char-s-Adventure)
