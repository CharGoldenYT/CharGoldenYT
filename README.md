Currently working on 5 projects.

- Char Engine (NO LINK YET) | Official Engine of the VS Char mod, mainly for stuff that I made a request to add into Universe Engine that got rejected for 1 reason or another.
- Blue Engine (NO LINK YET) | Engine started by me and [@MC077](https://github.com/MC077) based on psych, to add some random shit
