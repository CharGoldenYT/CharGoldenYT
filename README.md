## Bio
[I have a few discord servers](https://discord.vschar-official.com) and Mainly program in Haxe/HaxeFlixel, but occasionally use Python.

## Projects

Currently working on 6 projects. 
- [VS Char FNF mod](https://github.com/CharGolden-Games/VSChar-Universe-Engine) | A stupid Frday Night Funkin mod I'm cookin' up, it's a bit burnt though as it's been cooking for 2+ years.
- [Char's Adventure](https://github.com/CharGolden-Games/Char-s-Adventure) | A funny lil' standalone game that has no specific vision yet.
- [Universe Engine](https://github.com/Team-UniverseEngine/Universe-Engine) | Sick as hell engine that I am officially on the team for!
- Char Engine (NO LINK YET) | Official Engine of the VS Char mod, mainly for stuff that I made a request to add into Universe Engine that got rejected for 1 reason or another.
- [Char's Song Visualizer](https://github.com/CharGoldenYT/Char-s-Song-Visualizer) | Little funny project that's meant to be a music player that allows for easy creation of visualizers.

### Side Projects
